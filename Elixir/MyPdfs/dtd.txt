Done/To Do

Done:

- modified page safe zone to : 5.25 x 8.5 
- modified page margins: Left: 0.5, Right: 0.375, with mirroring odd/even
- modified page margins: Top 0.38, Bottom 0.38 (each margin value includes the bleed 0.13)
	iText specifies only one set of margins, so I add them up for each direction 
- total page size : 6.13 x 9.25
- changed orange + blue header height according to spec
- changed width of the blue part of header (page nr background)
- changed orange part width to fit, and space between orange/blue at specified value
- adjusted font and some proportions for the section title + scorebars to fit in the newer, smaller page size
- brought upper the tips section
- aligned image to keep the space mentioned between image bottom and light blue section 


To do (ideas):
- check overlap between resources and research papers - font size?
- image size/resolution changes - what is needed
- page number - a bit upper?
- others (to be decided)
